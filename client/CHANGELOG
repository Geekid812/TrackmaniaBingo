## Update 6.1
A hotfix update with a couple of balance changes!

### Frenzy - Balance Changes
- Reduced jail time from 15 minutes to 10 minutes
- Rainbow Tile can no longer be used to immediately create a bingo line

### Hotfixes
- Fixed a crash for "View Settings" inside a room
- Potentially fixed a crash for alt-tabbing out of the game in a room
- Fixed never ending jail time (the powerup now works as intended!)
- Fixed creating teams in a lobby would create an undefined black team and softlock the button
- Fixed host reconnection, you can now always go back to the room even after reconnecting!

### New: Match MVP
After a bingo is scored, the player who claimed the most maps for the winning team will be designated as the match MVP. They will get a shiny badge next to their name as a reward. Cool!
