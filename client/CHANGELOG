## Update 6.5

An important stability update with mostly bug fixes, but also a few Frenzy technical changes!

- **New Frenzy settings:** You can now configure how long the Jail and Rally items last. They will remain at 10 minutes by default for the forseeable future, but you are now free to customize their duration in the Item Settings panel. Thanks to Simber for contributing this new feature!
- **Jail has been nerfed:** You cannot send someone to Jail on a tile their team has already claimed or on a map which no one has claimed yet! Jail should now become a much less frustrating powerup to be hit with now that you can no longer be sent to any unbeatable maps on the grid.
- **New team colors, Team Editor upgrades:** The team cap has been raised to 10, the new team colors available by default in this update are: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Teal, Cyan, Blue, Purple, Magenta and Pink! The custom Team Editor should now also be clearer to use and it is no longer possible to accidentally softlock your lobby by deleting too many teams anymore.

Bug fixes in this update:
- Total end timer now includes grace period time (A full match of 20 minutes with 5 minutes grace period lasts 25 minutes!)
- Add fallback when a player isn't found in the current room to avoid crashing the plugin
- Perhaps you noticed too many powerups spawning in the Frenzy mode? That has been fixed and the powerups are back to normal, now properly matching the Item Rate setting.
- Fix crashes when tabbing out of the game when rendering the board
- Powerups and rerolls will now properly activate after their countdown even if they were moved around by a row/column shift powerup.
- New subtitles in the home screen! (Not a bug fix, but it's always cool to know)
