## Update 4.2

Quality of life update! Public profiles have been slightly tweaked, they now only show the amount of matches played. If you have won a daily challenge, it will also display your daily wins, as a small showoff.

There's also been a new addition to the Daily Challenge. You can now access the history of all past daily challenges, including how many players participated and who were the winners.

A couple of bugs have been fixed:

- Maps will be shuffled again when restarting a new game from the same room
- Fix invisible settings window
- Fix reroll button alignment issues
- Daily challenge timer is now correctly positioned
