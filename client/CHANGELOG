## Update 6.6

A minor update for some polishing here and there. Changelog here:

- Teams can be edited when the "Randomize Teams" option is enabled.
- Text rendering updated, unknown characters will now be removed instead of displaying incorrectly. Thanks to ArEyeses for helping with this!
- Added a new status icon in the room menu that indicates whether the maps have been successfully loaded, among other things.
- Competitive Patch now has some blacklisted plugins which are disabled during a match, including plugins such as UCI, Extra Leaderboard Positions, Map Rank and Map Info. The list of banned plugins may be updated in the future.
- Fixed maps not being reloaded after toggling "Map Discovery".
- Fixed losing host permissions upon reconnecting to a game.
- Fixed not being able to return to room after disconnecting from a game.
- Compatibility updates for the January 2026 Trackmania update.
