## Update 5.1

With this update, a new "Late Join" setting has been added to Bingo games. When this is enabled, new players can join even after a game has been started. New players can choose which team they want to join, and hop in the game instantly!

Keybind settings have also been added. You can now rebind the following keys in the plugin settings:
- Open Chat (default: Enter)
- Toggle Map List (default: Tab)

This update also fixes the following bugs:
- Fixed a crash when too many chat messages were sent.
- Fixed mappack loading from TMX by porting it to the new API. This may lead to longer load times for large mappacks because of pagination.
- Partially fix loading of multiple maps at the same time.
- Various UI fixes and tweaks.
