## Update 5.1

With this update, a new "Late Join" setting has been added to Bingo games. When this is enabled, new players can join even after a game has been started. New players can choose which team they want to join, and hop in the game instantly!

This update also fixes the following bugs:
- Fixed a crash when too many chat messages were sent.
- Fixed mappack loading from TMX by porting it to the new API. This may lead to longer load times for large mappacks because of pagination.
- Various UI fixes and tweaks.
