# Trackmania Bingo
This Openplanet plugin allows you to play a game of bingo with your friends!

> In this mode, two or more teams compete be the first to complete a row, column or diagonal on the game board. Each cell on this board corresponds to a track that players can claim for their team by achieving a specific medal on that track.

Feel free to contribute to the development of this project by submitting an issue or pull request!

### Backend

The source code for the backend of this plugin is located in [Geekid812/bingoserver](https://github.com/Geekid812/bingoserver).
It communicates via HTTP for client to server and TCP for server to client.

__Deprecation notice:__ The Python backend is currently being rewritten because of many issues. A new implementation in Rust is underway at [Geekid812/Bingohost](https://github.com/Geekid812/Bingohost) and is targeted to be released with plugin version 3.0.
